# msCNN-Clathrin
To ensure a direct and fair comparison with prior work, this study utilizes the identical benchmark dataset established by Le et al. , including the original training and independent test splits. The negative dataset comprises vesicular transport proteins, a choice made in the original study to pose a challenging classification task by compelling the model to learn subtle discriminative features rather than trivial differences between functionally distant proteins. This practice of selecting functionally related negative samples is considered a best practice in protein function prediction, as it reduces the risk of the model learning superficial shortcuts (Youngs et al., 2014; GligorijeviÄ‡ et al., 2021). For positive samples, curated clathrin protein sequences were retrieved from the Swiss-Prot database via NCBI, as defined in the original protocol.  

A critical aspect of this benchmark is the sequence redundancy removal protocol. While a more stringent identity cutoff (e.g., 30-40%) is common practice for creating non-redundant datasets to test model generalization, we adhere to the original 100% identity threshold protocol established by Le et al. and subsequently used by Target-CLP. This decision is methodological: by using the exact same data processing pipeline, we ensure that any observed performance improvements are attributable to our proposed model architecture and feature representations, rather than variations in the dataset, thus enabling a direct and unbiased performance benchmark. Following this procedure, the final dataset consists of 1546 high-confidence clathrin sequences and 1,360 non-clathrin sequences, partitioned into a cross-validation set (1288 clathrin and 1,133 non-clathrin) and an independent test set (258 clathrin and 227 non-clathrin). Complete dataset specifications are provided in Table 1.
